This hack is to get the memory (heap) usage of process at any point in time of a process. There are whole a lot of options available provided with this tool. Which can be used to fetch different kind of m/y usage in different ways.



To make use of this, down load this tar file and extract it to a location. 

if the libdbx_malloc.so is available at a different location other than present working directory then use PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to set the exact path.

run the program as 

heapstat PID <options>
